Anything found in this repo can be regarded as a test, experiment, or exercise as I follow along with the material on learncpp.com.

THE FOLLOWING CHANGES ARE MADE IN VSCODE VIA BOTH JSON FILES
THESE ARE EXACTLY AS PRESCRIBED IN LEARNCPP CHAPTER 0

1. Disable compiler extensions
2. Add a new line at the end of files to be compliant with the standard
3. Increase warning level (not necessary but useful)
4. Treat all warnings as errors (because if we don't handle them now, we never will)
5. Use the latest language standard
